#### Project Description -->  to generate a report for an independent gaming company by analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.. that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

#### Resources:
   * Folder HeroesOfPymoli : This folder contains 
      * 'Resources': Contains the data file 'purchase_data.csv'
   		* Jupyter notebook 'HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb' that has main script to run for analyzing the data stored in 'Resources/purchase_data.csv'
        * Word document 'conclusions.docx' with Written Report Presenting a cohesive written analysis that Draws three correct conclusions from the data for Pymoli
#### Key notes:
   * The report succesgully displays 
      * Total Players 
      * Purchase Analysis (Total)
      * Gender Demographics
      * Purchase Analysis (Gender)
      * Age Demographics
      * Purchasing Analysis (Age)
      * Top Spenders
      * Most Popular Items
      * Most profitable Items

   * Used multiple ways of createing pandas DataFrames where ever applicable by using lists , dictonaries and also by concatinating pandas series
   * Used functions (Examples: Mean(),Sum(),Count(),nunique()) to perform calculations 
   * Applied Group by in determining th following
      * Purchase Analysis (Gender)

  * The file has detailed comments expaling each segment
    
#### Results:
   * All the segments of jupiter notebook executed successfully generating the final report .
   * Successfully displays output identical to what was required
